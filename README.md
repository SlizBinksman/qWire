# qWire  
A Remote Access Kit for Windows.

# About qWire
qWire is a remote access kit for Windows. The purpose of this project is to work on my skills related to coding and explore the different ways remote access software can be put together. This project uses a basic client-server model. The code has been commented to the best of my ability at the time of creation as
I have found it's near impossible to remember what your code does after stepping away from a project for a certain period of time.

# How to setup qWire
